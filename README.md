Oak Tails is a role-playing world where players explore lands filled with adventurous leaves, mystical seeds, golems, and much more...

## Characters
### Locean
Locean is one of the main characters in Oak Tails. He's quite old, having become one of the first leaves to discover how to exist without his tree, allowing him to escape the annual Festival of the Fallen.

### Aris
Aris is another of the main characters in Oak Tails. She's a scientist and adventurer and is credited with discovering the process involved in existing and reattaching to her tree. She grew up with Locean and has both aged really well and has created the Make Like a Tree and Leave organization for teaching young leaves how to responsibly explore the world outside their tree.

### Orini
Orini is a golem from the mountains to the northeast. It is a little clumsy and accidentally knocked Locean from his tree while it was gathering nuts and fruit from the forest.

### Rasmil
